hoo boy, congratulations, looks like you've found a new way to waste time. Instead of endlessly writing, you can now endlessly type!
i'd write out a little to-do list or something, but my notebook already has most of that, and that's what the goal book is gonna be for, anyway.
not that there's much of use in the notebook.
who are these newbs arriving ten minutes before the lab-
the lab is over.
welp.
i'll save this, i guess
